# ❤️ Heart Disease EDA & Data Preprocessing

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of individuals at risk of heart disease.  
The goal was to understand the dataset thoroughly, clean and preprocess the data, and perform univariate and bivariate analysis to extract meaningful insights.  

The analysis was conducted using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, and the processed data was prepared for a **Linear Regression model**.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features.  
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of individual features, histograms, boxplots.  
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Correlations, scatterplots, and pairplots to explore relationships between variables.  
- **Visualizations**: Clear and informative plots to highlight patterns and insights.  
- **Insights & Conclusions**: Observations from the analysis that can guide predictive modeling.
